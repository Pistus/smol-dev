The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Package Dependencies**: All files share the dependencies defined in the `package.json` file. These include the Next.js framework, TypeScript, and any other libraries that are used across the application.

2. **TypeScript Configuration**: All TypeScript files (`.tsx`) share the configuration defined in the `tsconfig.json` file. This includes compiler options and type definitions.

3. **Next.js Configuration**: All files share the configuration defined in the `.next/config.js` file. This includes settings for server-side rendering and routing.

4. **React Components**: The `_app.tsx` and `_document.tsx` files are shared across all pages in the Next.js application. The `Header.tsx` and `Footer.tsx` components may also be used across multiple pages.

5. **CSS Styles**: The `globals.css` file is shared across all pages and components in the application. The `Home.module.css` file may be used in the `index.tsx` file and any other components that are part of the home page.

6. **Public Assets**: The `favicon.ico` and `vercel.svg` files in the `public` directory are shared across all pages in the application.

7. **Function Names**: Any functions that are defined in one file and used in another are shared dependencies. The exact function names will depend on the specific implementation of the application.

8. **DOM Element IDs**: Any IDs that are assigned to DOM elements and used in JavaScript functions are shared dependencies. The exact ID names will depend on the specific implementation of the application.

9. **Message Names**: Any message names used for communication between different parts of the application are shared dependencies. The exact message names will depend on the specific implementation of the application.
